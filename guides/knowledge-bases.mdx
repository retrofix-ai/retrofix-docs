Knowledge Bases allow you to connect applications and query them within your workflows and with Reggie for context-aware automation.

---

## Overview

Knowledge Bases (Beta) enable you to:
- Connect knowledge base applications to RetroFix
- Query your internal documentation and data
- Provide context to agents and Reggie
- Keep information automatically up-to-date

---

## How Knowledge Bases Work

### 1. Connect an Application

Select an application to use as a knowledge base. Common options include:
- **Notion** - Connect your wikis, docs, and databases
- **Confluence** - Use your team documentation
- **Other supported knowledge bases** - Additional options available

### 2. Indexing

RetroFix automatically indexes your connected base on a schedule to maintain up-to-date information.

- **Automatic updates** - Knowledge bases refresh regularly
- **No manual sync needed** - Changes are picked up automatically
- **Reliable access** - Always have current information available

### 3. Query in Workflows

Use knowledge bases in your workflows to:
- Answer questions about your data
- Search for specific information
- Retrieve documentation
- Access customer or product information

---

## Use Cases

### Answer Questions About Your Data

Automatically look up information from your knowledge base to answer user questions or inform workflow decisions.

**Example:** When a customer emails a support question, automatically search your knowledge base for relevant documentation or FAQ answers to inform the response.

### Provide Context to Agents

Give AI agents access to your knowledge bases so they can make informed decisions.

**Example:** A customer service agent with access to:
- Product documentation
- Company policies
- Customer history
- Pricing information

The agent can then handle customer inquiries accurately and consistently.

### Empower Reggie

Reggie can search your knowledge bases to understand what's possible and make better automation recommendations.

**Example:** Tell Reggie "Help me automate the onboarding process" and he can:
- Search your knowledge base for onboarding procedures
- Understand your current process
- Recommend automation opportunities
- Build workflows based on your documentation

### Document Search in Workflows

Extract specific information from your connected knowledge bases.

**Example:** Automatically extract pricing information, feature specifications, or troubleshooting steps from your documentation.

## Best Practices

### Keep It Organized

- **Structure your data clearly** - Well-organized sources are easier to search
- **Use consistent naming** - Similar items should have similar names
- **Add descriptions** - Include metadata to help with searches

### Manage Content

- **Keep it current** - Regularly update your knowledge base content
- **Remove outdated information** - Delete or archive old documents
- **Version documentation** - Track changes when relevant

### Use Effectively

- **Be specific in searches** - More specific queries return better results
- **Provide examples** - Show agents what kind of information to look for
- **Monitor accuracy** - Check that retrieved information is correct
- **Refine over time** - Improve knowledge base structure based on query results

## Knowledge Base Limitations

- Currently in **Beta** - Features and availability may change
- **Search capability** - Searches are as good as your knowledge base organization
- **Update frequency** - Automatic indexing happens on a schedule, not in real-time
- **Content size** - Very large knowledge bases may have performance considerations
