## Overview

RetroFix keeps detailed logs of every workflow run for troubleshooting and analysis.

### Retention

- **Logs saved for** 30 days by default
- **Full history** - All run details preserved
- **Accessible anytime** - Access past runs for debugging

---

## Viewing Runs

### Inside a Workflow

View runs for a specific workflow:

1. Open the workflow
2. Click **"View Runs"** in the workflow configuration
3. See all runs for that workflow in chronological order

### Global View

View all runs across all workflows:

1. Click the **Runs** tab on the sidebar
2. See all workflows and their recent runs
3. Filter and search across workflows

---

## Run Information

Each run shows:

- **Status** - Running, Success, Failed, or Cancelled
- **Timestamp** - When the run started and ended
- **Duration** - How long the run took to complete
- **Trigger** - What triggered the run (manual, scheduled, event)
- **Input data** - Data that triggered the workflow
- **Step results** - Output from each step
- **Errors** - Details if something went wrong

### Step-by-Step Details

Click on a run to see:

- **Each step's input** - What data went into the step
- **Each step's output** - What data came out
- **Execution order** - How steps ran (parallel or sequential)
- **Loop details** - Info for each loop iteration
- **Test values** - Variables at that point in execution
- **Error messages** - Detailed error information

## Run Statuses

### Running

The workflow is currently executing.

- Can be in progress for minutes or hours
- See live progress in some cases
- Can be cancelled if needed

### Success

The workflow completed successfully.

- All steps executed as expected
- Final output is ready
- No errors occurred

### Failed

The workflow encountered an error.

- See the exact step that failed
- View the error message
- Replay with fixes

### Cancelled

The run was manually stopped.

- By clicking the X button while running
- Usually to stop an unexpected behavior
- Data up to cancellation is still logged

---

## Debugging Failed Runs

### Find the Error

1. Open the failed run
2. Look for the first step marked as failed
3. Read the error message
4. Check the step's input and output

### Common Issues

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Missing Data">
    The step couldn't find expected data from previous steps.

    **Check:**
    - Is the variable name correct?
    - Did the previous step actually return data?
    - Are you inside a loop or conditional?
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Authentication Failed">
    The integration lost access to the connected service.

    **Fix:**
    - Go to Integrations and reconnect the service
    - Verify credentials are still valid
    - Check if the service requires re-authorization
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API Error">
    The service rejected the request.

    **Check:**
    - Valid API parameters?
    - Service is online and available?
    - Rate limits exceeded?
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Replay Functionality

### What is Replay?

Replay re-runs a failed (or successful) workflow with the same input data but using a different version of the workflow.

This is powerful for testing fixes without waiting for the next natural trigger.

### How to Replay

1. Open a run you want to replay
2. Click **"Replay"**
3. Choose which version to use:
   - **Draft** - Test your changes before publishing
   - **Published version** - Use a specific published version
4. The workflow runs with the same input data

---

## Cancelling Runs

### Cancel a Running Workflow

While a workflow is executing:

1. Find the running run in the list
2. Click the **X button** next to it
3. The run stops immediately
4. Already-processed data is logged

<Warning>
Cancelling doesn't undo any changes made before the cancellation point. Be careful with workflows that modify external data.
</Warning>
