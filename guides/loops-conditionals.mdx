description: "Control workflow execution with loops and conditional branching"
---

Loops and conditionals give you fine-grained control over workflow execution for more complex automation scenarios.

---

## Loops

Loops allow you to iterate over a list of data to run a set of steps for each item—similar to "for loops" in programming.

### How it works

1. Click on a loop to configure it
2. Select from a dropdown of all available list variables from previous steps
3. Repeat the set of steps for each item in the list

### Parallel Execution

<Tip>
  RetroFix runs the set of steps for each item in the list **in parallel** up to your concurrency limits (default: 20 for all paid plans).
</Tip>

### Using Loop Data

Inside a loop, use the **"Loop Items"** variable to access individual items.

**Test values:** When testing, you'll see values from the **first item** in the test outputs from the list provided.

### Example

Fetch a list of LinkedIn profiles from Google Sheets, and for each one:

1. Enrich the profile with additional data
2. Save the contact information back to Google Sheets

## Conditionals

Conditionals allow you to take different paths in your workflow depending on conditions applied to data from previous steps.

### Features

- Create **any number of branches**
- Use **AI-based conditions** (default) or **manual conditions**
- Control branch execution behavior

### Branch Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="If">
    The first condition branch. Always evaluated first.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Else If">
    Additional condition branches between If and Else for more granular control.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Else">
    Runs only if every other condition was false.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Condition Modes

#### AI-Based Conditions (Default)

Describe the condition in plain English, and RetroFix uses AI to evaluate it at runtime.

**Example:** "if the following email sounds happy: @email"

**Advantages:** Natural language, flexible evaluation

#### Manual Conditions

Set specific conditions without AI evaluation.

**Example:** "if @email is not empty"

**Advantages:** Deterministic, predictable

### Execution Behavior

By default, all branches with successful conditions will run.

**Example scenario:**

- If branch checks "is email happy"
- Else If branch checks "is email long"
- Email is both happy and long → both branches run

<Note>
  You can toggle per branch to run conditions **sequentially** instead. With sequential execution, only the first matching condition executes.
</Note>

### Sequential Execution

When enabled on a branch:

- Only check this condition if all previous conditions were false
- Stops checking once a condition matches
- Provides "if/else if/else" behavior

## Combining Loops & Conditionals

You can nest loops and conditionals for complex workflows:

- Put conditionals inside loops to handle different items differently
- Use loops inside conditional branches to process matching items in batches
- Combine with other actions for sophisticated automation logic
