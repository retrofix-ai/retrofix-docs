---

Create your own AI agents that run as steps in your workflow to handle complex automation scenarios.

---

## Overview

Agents are AI-powered workflow steps that can make intelligent decisions and take actions based on your instructions.

### How it works

1. Define custom instructions for the agent
2. Grant the agent access to tools it can use
3. The agent uses those tools to accomplish your goals
4. Data flows from previous steps through the agent to subsequent steps

---

## Agent Capabilities

### Custom Instructions

Provide agents with specific instructions on how to behave and what to prioritize.

**Examples:**
- "Be concise and professional in all responses"
- "Always verify data before taking action"
- "Prioritize security and accuracy over speed"

### Tool Access

Give agents access to:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="External Integrations">
    Any action from your connected applications (with your permission).

    **Examples:**
    - Send Slack messages
    - Create Google Calendar events
    - Write to Google Sheets
    - Post to social media
    - Send emails

    <Tip>
      Grant tool access selectively. Only provide access to actions the agent actually needs.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Web Search">
    Built-in web search tools for real-time information gathering.

    **Use cases:**
    - Look up current information
    - Find API documentation
    - Research competitors
    - Verify facts and data
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Knowledge Bases">
    Access to your connected knowledge bases for internal knowledge.

    **Use cases:**
    - Reference company policies
    - Look up internal documentation
    - Find answers in your wikis or databases
    - Access customer information
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## When to Use Agents

### Conversational Chatbot Workflows

Build interactive workflows that have multi-turn conversations with users.

**Example:** Create a customer service chatbot that can:
- Answer common questions
- Look up customer information
- Create support tickets
- Provide personalized recommendations

### Uncertain Logic

Use agents when it's unclear what set of actions should be taken each time the workflow runs.

**Example:** An email processing agent that:
- Reads incoming emails
- Decides on priority level
- Routes to appropriate team
- Takes different actions based on content

### Complex Decision Making

Agents can evaluate complex scenarios and make nuanced decisions.

**Example:** A data validation agent that:
- Checks data quality
- Identifies inconsistencies
- Researches corrections using web search
- Updates records accordingly

## Best Practices

- **Be specific with instructions** - Detailed instructions lead to better results
- **Start simple** - Begin with basic instructions and add complexity as needed
- **Test thoroughly** - Run test workflows to verify agent behavior
- **Monitor outputs** - Check the run logs to see what decisions the agent made
- **Refine over time** - Adjust instructions based on real-world performance
- **Limit tool access** - Only grant necessary permissions for security and clarity

---

## Tips for Better Agent Performance

1. **Use clear language** - Avoid ambiguous terms or instructions
2. **Provide context** - Tell the agent what information matters and why
3. **Set boundaries** - Specify what the agent should NOT do
4. **Include examples** - Provide examples of desired behavior when possible
5. **Leverage knowledge bases** - Upload relevant documentation for the agent to reference
