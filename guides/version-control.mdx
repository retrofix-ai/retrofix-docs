RetroFix's version control system lets you safely iterate on workflows, test changes, and roll back if needed.

---

## Overview

Version control helps you:
- Save different versions of your workflow
- Test changes safely
- Roll back to previous versions
- Control which version runs in production

### Key Concepts

- **Version** - A published snapshot of your workflow
- **Draft** - Unsaved changes to the current version
- **Published Version** - The version currently active and running

---

## Publishing Changes

### Create a Version

Click the **Publish** button to save the current workflow state as a new version.

### What Gets Published

- All workflow steps and configuration
- Trigger setup
- Action parameters
- Loops, conditionals, and branching
- Step locks and disabled steps

---

## Switching Versions

### View All Versions

Open the version history to see all published versions of your workflow by clicking "View History"

- **Timestamps** - See when each version was created
- **Changes** - View what changed between versions
- **Revert** - Go back to any previous version

### Activate a Different Version

Switch between versions to control which one runs:

1. Open version history
2. Select the version you want to use
3. Click "Restore Version"

<Warning>
Selecting an old version from "View History" sets it as your current workflow draft. You must re-publish it (with any changes or as-is) for it to be used in active runs.
</Warning>

## Draft Management

### Understanding Drafts

A "Draft" is any unsaved changes you've made since the last publish.

- **Only in your editor** - Drafts don't affect live workflows
- **Visible in version history** - Shown as "Draft" or "Unsaved Changes"
- **Safe to experiment** - Test anything without affecting production

### Testing Drafts

When manually running a workflow, you can choose:
- **Run Draft** - Test your changes before publishing
- **Run Latest Published Version** - Use the currently active version

### Reverting Draft Changes

Discard all changes from your draft:

1. Open the workflow
2. Click the revert/undo button
3. Confirm you want to discard changes

Your workflow returns to the most recently published version.
