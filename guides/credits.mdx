Credits are RetroFix's usage-based pricing system. Learn how they work and how to monitor your usage.

---

## Overview

RetroFix uses a credit system for billing. Most actions are free—you only pay for workflow runs and premium features.

### Key Principles

- **Most steps are free** - External integrations don't cost credits
- **Pay for execution** - You're charged based on actual workflow runs
- **Transparent pricing** - See exact costs before configuring steps

---

## Monitoring Usage

### Check Your Balance

Visit the **Credits** page in RetroFix to see:
- Current credit balance
- Credit cost for different steps in RetroFix

### Usage History

Each workflow run will show you how many steps each action cost.

## Optimizing Credit Usage

### Reduce Loop Costs

Loops are efficient for parallel processing, but they do cost credits.

**Optimization strategies:**
- **Batch operations** - Process multiple items per loop iteration
- **Filter before looping** - Only loop over items you need
- **Use conditionals** - Skip unnecessary processing with if/else branches

**Example:**
Instead of looping all 1000 users:
- Filter to only active users (200 items)
- Loop over 200 items = 100 credits (vs 500 credits)
- Saves 400 credits per run

### Purchase Credits

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Select a credit package
3. Choose payment method
4. Credits are added to your account immediately

### Overage Handling

- If you run out of credits, your workflows will give a "Not enough credits" error. You can purchase more credits in the /billing page.
