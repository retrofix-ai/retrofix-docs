Actions are the primary building blocks for RetroFix workflows. They define what your workflow actually does with the data.

---

## Adding Actions

### Quick Start

To add a new action:

1. Hover your cursor above or below any existing step in the workflow
2. Click the plus button that appears
3. Click "Add Action"
4. Select an application from the panel (e.g., Gmail)
5. Select from pre-built actions we support for that service

#### Custom API Actions

For external integrations, if there's something you want to do that's available via API but we don't have a pre-built action for, you can prompt **Reggie** to create a new step using code that will call that API with your provided credentials.

### Configuring Actions

To configure an action:
- **Click** on it to see required parameters (toggle to view optional ones)
- **Cmd/Ctrl + click** to open a detailed configuration panel with more visibility
- View variable values when testing and action outputs

---

## Testing & Readiness

<Tip>
Before you can use outputs from an action in subsequent steps, you must test that step first to mark it as ready and gain access to the output data.
</Tip>

**If you don't need to test a step** (e.g., Send Slack Message), you can mark it as ready by:
1. Clicking the small arrow next to the test button
2. Selecting "Mark as Ready"

---

## Using Variables

### Overview

You can use outputs from the trigger or previous steps as inputs in subsequent steps.

**Example:** Set up a workflow to check if incoming emails are spam. Use the "email content" variable from the trigger in an AI step for categorization.

### How to Insert Variables

Type `@` in any text box when configuring a step to see all available variables and select the one you want.

### View Test Values

Click the **"Test Values"** button at the bottom of the configuration pane to see all values being used for variables in that step.

## Types of Actions

### Internal Integrations

RetroFix directly integrates with premium services including:
- **AI generation** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
- **Data enrichment** - Fiber.ai (people enrichment)
- **Document processing** - Reducto.ai
- **Web research** - Exa.ai, Perplexity.ai

Use these directly without connecting anything else. RetroFix charges credits instead of you managing billing separately.

### External Integrations

Connect over **2,800+** external applications including Gmail, Notion, Google Sheets, Slack, and more to create workflows that work with your existing tools.

#### Connecting an Integration

You have three options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Ask Reggie">
    Tell Reggie something like "Help me connect Gmail" and he'll pop up a dialog you can click to connect the application
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Integrations Page">
    1. Go to the **Integrations** page from the sidebar
    2. Search through available integrations
    3. Connect as many accounts as you'd like
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Add from Workflow">
    Add the desired action to the workflow. RetroFix will prompt you to connect an account before allowing you to configure the action.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Utilities

RetroFix exposes utility steps for more flexibility in your workflows:
- **Wait** - Pause execution
- **Stop Workflow** - Terminate workflow execution

---

## Step Management

### Disable a Step

When you disable a step:
- It stays saved in the configuration
- It will **not** be executed during the workflow run
- Its outputs will **not** be available to other steps

### Lock a Step

When you lock a step:
- It still runs as expected
- Neither you nor Reggie can modify it until unlocked
- Useful for locking up core workflow logic while Reggie tweaks other things like prompts and formatting
